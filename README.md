# python_django

Bare bones of a Django app following the tutorial (for version 1.7) found here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/

Within the 'mysite' folder are the 'mysite' and 'polls' folders. 'mysite/mysite' contains configuration information for Django to use when running the app contained in the 'mysite/polls' folder.
